Smart Home Automation System 🏡

A Java-based Smart Home Automation System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project is being developed incrementally, starting with a file-based and terminal-based model, then progressing to a more interactive system with user input handling and a graphical user interface (GUI).

Features                                                                                                                  
✅ Device Management – Add, remove, and control smart devices.                                                  
✅ Automation Rules – Set schedules and conditions for device operation.                                                      
✅ User Interaction – Initially through the terminal, later with a GUI.                                        
✅ Data Storage – File-based system for initial versions.                                                  

Development Stages
1️⃣ File-Based & Terminal Interface – Basic functionalities with simple input/output.                                                                                    
2️⃣ User Input Handling – Enhancing interaction for better usability.                                                                                    
3️⃣ GUI Implementation – Transitioning to a graphical interface for improved user experience.
